# Mars Explorer Problem

This application was developed by Rodolfo Andrés Ramírez Valenzuela and
Fernando Gómez Herrera as part of the Artificial Intelligence class.

This application simulates the behaivor of a reactive agent. It implements
the Mars Explorer problem is described as follows:

The Mars Explorer problem is situated on a random field, where agents are placed in order
to find rocks that are placed in random positions. They need to find the rocks which are known
to be accumulated in a zone. Mars is a troublesome planet, which disables communicaton between the agents
this way, the agents should move randomly in order to find the rocks in the planet. The Mars Explorer
Problem is divided into single and cooperative aproach, while in the single aproach it moves randomly,
until it finds a rock and then goes back to the base. On the cooperative approach the agents will leave
a trail of crumbs when they find a rock, in order for another agent to follow those crumbs and
get the rock.

The application uses the following technologies:

- Python 2.7.6
- Pygame 1.9.1
- GameObjects 0.0.3

## Installing the application
    # Setup the project
    Clone the repository

    # Run application
    sh run.sh

  Once the app is running, you will be able to simulate the single and cooperative aproach.
